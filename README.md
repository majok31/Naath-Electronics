# Naath-Electronics - Online Electronics Store

Naath-Electronics is an e-commerce platform where users can browse and purchase their preferred electronics products. I built this store using core frontend technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project showcases a fully functional online store with a culturally inspired name, rooted in the Nuer heritage of South Sudan.

## Project Overview

I created Naath-Elctronics store to provide a simple, user-friendly platform for buying electronics. The site leverages:

- **HTML**: Forms the skeleton of the website, setting up its basic structure.
- **CSS**: Adds styling to make the site visually appealing and engaging, enhancing the user experience.
- **JavaScript**: Brings interactivity and functionality, including dynamic product displays and cart features.
- **jQuery**: Incorporated for additional ease in handling DOM manipulations and events.

This project reflects my passion for frontend development and cultural representation, blending modern tech with Nuer identity ("Naath" means "people" in the Nuer language).

## Features

- Responsive product grid layout.
- Interactive "Add to Cart" functionality.
- Clean and intuitive user interface.
- Dynamic cart counter updates.
